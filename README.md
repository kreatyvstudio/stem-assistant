<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

### Challenge Statement

Despite the growing importance of STEM subjects, many young students, particularly girls, lack access to supportive and approachable guidance and mentorship, leading to a gap in STEM engagement and understanding. How can we make STEM subjects more approachable and less intimidating for these students?

### Proposed Solution

Curio, the Cat is a virtual AI assistant designed to be a friendly and supportive tutor for elementary school kids to support their learning of STEM subjects.
* Curio is a friendly virtual character that kids can chat with to ask questions and discuss STEM topics.
* The Curio chat app is powered by Open AI’s API and configured to have a friendly personality that uses appropriate language for school-age children, is provided constraints to only discuss STEM topics, and, like a tutor, walks the user through the process of a solution instead of providing direct answers.
